# Bank Loan Analysis Project using SQL

## Description
This project performs a comprehensive analysis of bank loan data using SQL queries on two datasets (Finance1 and Finance2). It calculates key performance indicators (KPIs) such as year-wise loan amounts, grade-wise revolving balances, payment totals by verification status, state-wise loan statuses, and home ownership versus last payment date statistics. The project demonstrates data cleaning, joining datasets, aggregation, and formatting results for insightful financial reporting.

## Project Overview
The project involves importing and validating loan datasets into a MySQL database, then using SQL queries to extract meaningful insights. It focuses on solving five major KPIs by leveraging aggregate functions, joins, grouping, and date functions. The results can be used to create dashboards for better decision-making in financial institutions.

## Objective
- To analyze loan data effectively using SQL queries.  
- To calculate and report key financial metrics such as loan amounts, payment totals, and loan statuses.  
- To demonstrate data handling techniques including joins, grouping, and date manipulation in SQL.  
- To provide a foundation for building financial dashboards and reports based on loan data.
